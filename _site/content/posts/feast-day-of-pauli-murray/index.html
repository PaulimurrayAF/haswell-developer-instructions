<p>July 1 marks the <strong>Feast Day of Rev. Dr. Pauli Murray, Esq.</strong>, a moment in the Episcopal Church calendar when the faithful pause to honor a soul whose life and legacy still ripple through our movements, our identities, and our demands for justice. For us at the Pauli Murray Awards Foundation, it’s more than a date on a calendar. It’s a call to remembrance. A call to action. A call to become.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Episcopal tradition</strong>, a feast day is a formal moment of recognition—when a saint, martyr, or significant figure in the Christian faith is commemorated. To be granted a feast day is to have one’s life acknowledged as having enduring <strong>spiritual significance and moral witness</strong>. And to see Pauli Murray’s name etched into that sacred rhythm of the church year is nothing short of revolutionary.</p>
<p>Pauli Murray was a poet and a priest. A lawyer and a laborer. A visionary who shattered barriers and reimagined what freedom could look like. They were the first Black person assigned female at birth to be ordained as an Episcopal priest. They helped lay the legal groundwork for <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>. They coined the term “Jane Crow” to describe the twin oppressions of racism and sexism. They lived a gender-expansive life long before language caught up—and they did it while confronting both invisibility and institutional power.</p>
<p>To celebrate Pauli Murray as a <strong>saint</strong> is to affirm that holiness lives in resistance. That sacredness can look like a body the world misgenders. That faith can drive a life of rigorous dissent.</p>
<p>Their recognition as a saint is not symbolic—it is seismic. It reminds us that Black queer and trans people are not afterthoughts in the story of justice. We are architects. We are prophets. We are, as Pauli once wrote, “the impudent ones” who dare to live free.</p>
<p>At the Pauli Murray Awards Foundation, we are building on this legacy. We exist to uplift Black LGBTQ+ changemakers—artists, healers, scientists, educators, and everyday revolutionaries—who are living out Pauli’s legacy in real time. On this Feast Day, we recommit ourselves to visibility, to joy, to truth, and to the radical possibility that honoring the past can unlock the future.</p>
<p>We invite you to celebrate with us: Light a candle. Say their name. Tell their story. And then—like Pauli—get back to work.</p>
