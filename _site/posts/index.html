<p><strong>Introducing the Inaugural Board of Directors of the Pauli Murray Awards Foundation</strong></p>
<p>The Pauli Murray Awards Foundation was born from a conviction: that Black LGBTQ+ brilliance should not only be honored, but invested in. That conviction is now being stewarded by a remarkable group of leaders who bring experience, insight, and a deep sense of purpose to the work ahead.</p>
<p>Today, I am honored to introduce the inaugural <strong>Board of Directors</strong> of the Pauli Murray Awards Foundation.</p>
<p>These individuals have committed to shaping the future of this organization with integrity, care, and a shared belief in the transformative power of visibility, legacy, and community. They reflect the values of the Foundation itselfâ€”liberation, leadership, and love for our people.</p>
