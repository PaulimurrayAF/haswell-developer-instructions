**Why the Pauli Murray Awards Honor Black LGBTQ+ Changemakers Under 40**

**Too often, our people are celebrated only after they’re exhausted—or gone.** We created the Pauli Murray Awards to shift that timeline. To give recognition in real time. To make sure Black LGBTQ+ brilliance isn’t left waiting in the wings.

Here’s why we honor 40 under 40—and why it matters now more than ever:

- - -

### We’ve waited long enough to give people their flowers

I’ve watched it happen again and again—people pouring their hearts into community, fighting systems with nothing but vision and faith, scraping together resources, holding everybody else up… only to be celebrated when they’re burned out, bowed out, or gone. And by then? It’s mostly applause echoing into the silence.

That’s not how it should be. And that’s not how it has to be.

Think about the last awards show you watched: the standing ovations, the glittering trophies, the tear-soaked tributes delivered **after** the honoree spent decades in the trenches. What might have happened if the applause—and the support—had come earlier?

### Built for the Now

The **Pauli Murray Awards: 40 Under 40 Black LGBTQ+ Honors** flip the script. Too often, Black queer brilliance is ignored until it’s convenient to celebrate. We focus on those under 40 because so many of us start doing transformative work long before anyone thinks to hand us a mic, an award, or a check.

We’re not giving out “Best Newcomer” ribbons. We’re saying: *You’re already the story. You’re already leading. You deserve to be honored now.*

- - -

### A lesson from Pauli Murray

Pauli’s legal theories helped dismantle school segregation in **Brown v. Board of Education**, and inspired the gender-equality arguments Justice Ginsburg later used. Their activism, poetry, priesthood—all revolutionary.

But most of the recognition came **after** their death.

Imagine if someone had said, *We see you. We got you. Let us help lift the load.* That’s what the PMAs are about.

### Why We Prioritize Emerging Leaders

**• Relieve immediate pressure.** Early- and mid-career leaders juggle student-loan debt, caretaking, housing costs, and the everyday grind of building something from scratch. A $1,000 grant can mean the difference between burnout and breathing room.

**• Catalyze momentum.** A professional cohort of like-minded visionaries—plus national spotlight—extends their runway and multiplies their impact. This isn’t just résumé-building. It’s movement-building.

**• Amplify voices still muffled by bias.** Racism, homophobia, transphobia, and ageism still silence Black LGBTQ+ brilliance. Recognition now is resistance.

**• Shift cultural expectations.** Awards culture usually saves the serious honors for elders. We reject the idea that brilliance needs wrinkles before it’s legitimate.

**• Seed generational legacy.** When young changemakers thrive, they mentor, hire, publish, and clear the way for those coming behind them.

### A moment that sticks with me

Last summer I met Toni, a 27-year-old trans organizer in Detroit running a mutual-aid pantry out of her basement. She was behind on rent, but still delivering groceries to elders on her block. A $1,000 grant could’ve kept the her from eviction—and doubled her weekly food deliveries.

That’s the kind of impact the PMAs are built for.

- - -

### More than a trophy—an ecosystem

Every honoree joins a **year-long PMA Cohort**, where they receive:

* **Strategy Labs** with national mentors
* **Legacy & Archiving sessions** to document their work
* **Mental health resources** and coaching
* A platform to showcase their brilliance on **National Coming Out Day** (October 11, 2026)

We’re not just applauding—we’re investing.

- - -

### We honor legacy and momentum

Our **Lifetime Achievement Award** uplifts the elders who made our present possible. We also honor accomplices, rising stars under 18, and other allies pushing for Black LGBTQ+ liberation.

It’s not either/or. It’s both/and. Legacy *and* emergence. Roots *and* wings.

- - -

### Why this matters

We built these awards because too many of us die before we hear “thank you.”

Because recognition opens doors to deeper healing, bolder risk, and bigger dreams.

Because **we deserve to be seen while we’re still breathing.**

- - -

Pauli once wrote, *“Hope is a song in a weary throat.”* The Pauli Murray Awards aim to make that hope louder—*now, not later.*

We’re celebrating Black LGBTQ+ visionaries while their voices are still ringing.

**That’s why we honor 40 under 40.**
