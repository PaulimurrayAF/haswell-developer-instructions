**Introducing the Inaugural Board of Directors of the Pauli Murray Awards Foundation**

The Pauli Murray Awards Foundation was born from a conviction: that Black LGBTQ+ brilliance should not only be honored, but invested in. That conviction is now being stewarded by a remarkable group of leaders who bring experience, insight, and a deep sense of purpose to the work ahead.

Today, I am honored to introduce the inaugural **Board of Directors** of the Pauli Murray Awards Foundation.

These individuals have committed to shaping the future of this organization with integrity, care, and a shared belief in the transformative power of visibility, legacy, and community. They reflect the values of the Foundation itself‚Äîliberation, leadership, and love for our people.
